# Upcoming Movies Sample in Swift

Upcoming Movies is a sample ios app built using swift that displays the details of upcoming movies. The project consumes rest api provided by [THE MOVIE DB](https://www.themoviedb.org).

## Motivation

The project demonstrates the use of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for development of native iOS applications. We use MVVM a lot for developing native applications at [CodeToArt](http://codetoart.com/). Following is the visual representation of application architecture.
